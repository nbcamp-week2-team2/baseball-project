## Project Name: Baseball Game 

---
### Goal: Create the Baseball Game
### Description
This is like a guessing game. The computer generate a random number, which has unique numbers which have some constraints; 1. 1. Each digits shouldn't be repetitive,
2. 3 digits (which is bounded by 100 - 999).

The user input is also a unique number, as same as above, but there are few things;
1. The first digit shouldn't be "0"
2. The user input shouldn't be characters.

Then, it's basically guesing game. If the user's input digit is same digit and place, it counts strike. If the user's input digit contains the answer digit, it counts ball.

### Results
I was able to finish the project with all steps are shown above, and meet the criteria below.
